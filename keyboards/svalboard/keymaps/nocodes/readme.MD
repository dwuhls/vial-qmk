This is a codeless, 5 layer keymap compatible with loading .vil files to set everything up.

It lets you test the entire keyboard in the Vial matrix tester without worrying about spurious keys due to keys being not installed or hardware being bad.

To build it, simply copy it over keymap.c in the vial folder.  Remember to save the old one if you're faffing about with this...
